It is divided into three sub-datasets: BasinATLAS, RiverATLAS, and LakeATLAS, representing sub-basin delineations, river network, and lake shorelines, respectively. It contains 1.0 million sub-basins, 8.5 million river reaches, and 1.4 million lakes, with 56 hydro-environmental variables grouped into seven categories: hydrology, physiography, climate, land cover & use, soils & geology, and anthropogenic influences.",
